## Disclaimer about a better understanding of the code-flow

▪ There is a table of content inside every file (at the bottom of the file).
▪ It contains the main purpose of this file & a list of sub-steps (they only exist, if the code isn't readable enough through variable names).
▪ You can use "Ctrl + F" to easily find specific chapters of it inside the file.
